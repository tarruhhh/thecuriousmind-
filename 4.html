<div class="container">
    <h2>Mathematics Concepts for Grade 4</h2>
    <p>In Grade 4, students will build upon the foundation they developed in earlier grades and tackle more complex concepts in mathematics. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key topics that Grade 4 students will learn in math:</p>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>1. Advanced Multiplication and Division</h2>
        <p>Grade 4 students deepen their understanding of multiplication and division:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiply larger numbers (up to 4-digit numbers) by 1-digit and 2-digit numbers.</li>
            <li>Divide larger numbers (up to 4-digit numbers) by 1-digit divisors, including with remainders.</li>
            <li>Learn to use the distributive property to break down multiplication problems.</li>
            <li>Solve word problems involving multiplication and division in real-world contexts.</li>
            <li>Explore multiplication of multi-digit numbers by two-digit numbers.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>2. Fractions and Decimals</h2>
        <p>Students in Grade 4 learn to work with fractions and decimals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compare and order fractions and decimals.</li>
            <li>Learn to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators by finding common denominators.</li>
            <li>Convert between fractions and decimals (e.g., 1/2 = 0.5, 3/4 = 0.75).</li>
            <li>Multiply and divide fractions by whole numbers (e.g., 2 Ã— 3/4 = 6/4).</li>
            <li>Understand decimal place value (tenths, hundredths, thousandths) and represent decimals up to two decimal places.</li>
            <li>Compare decimals and round decimals to the nearest tenth or hundredth.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>3. Addition and Subtraction of Larger Numbers</h2>
        <p>In Grade 4, students work with larger numbers for addition and subtraction:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add and subtract numbers up to 10,000 using regrouping (carrying and borrowing).</li>
            <li>Solve multi-step word problems that involve addition and subtraction of large numbers.</li>
            <li>Apply estimation techniques to check the reasonableness of sums and differences.</li>
            <li>Use mental math strategies to add and subtract efficiently.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>4. Measurement</h2>
        <p>Grade 4 students learn about both metric and customary units of measurement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Convert between units of measurement (e.g., inches to feet, milliliters to liters, grams to kilograms).</li>
            <li>Calculate the perimeter and area of regular and irregular shapes.</li>
            <li>Measure and convert units of time, including hours, minutes, and seconds.</li>
            <li>Use both standard (inches, feet, pounds) and metric (millimeters, centimeters, kilograms) systems of measurement.</li>
            <li>Solve real-life problems involving the measurement of length, weight, and capacity.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>5. Geometry and Angles</h2>
        <p>Grade 4 students deepen their understanding of geometry:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Classify and describe 2D shapes (e.g., rectangles, triangles, circles, polygons) and 3D shapes (e.g., cubes, cones, pyramids, spheres).</li>
            <li>Identify and measure angles (right angles, acute angles, obtuse angles) using a protractor.</li>
            <li>Learn about symmetry and identify lines of symmetry in shapes.</li>
            <li>Understand the properties of different types of triangles (equilateral, isosceles, scalene).</li>
            <li>Calculate the perimeter and area of simple polygons.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>6. Data and Graphing</h2>
        <p>Students work with data and learn to represent it visually:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect and organize data in tables and lists.</li>
            <li>Interpret data from bar graphs, pictographs, and line plots.</li>
            <li>Analyze and solve problems using data in graphs.</li>
