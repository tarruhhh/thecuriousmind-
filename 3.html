    <h2>Mathematics Concepts for Grade 3</h2>
    <p>In Grade 3, students build on their foundational math skills by learning new concepts, exploring numbers in more depth, and applying math to solve real-world problems. Below is an overview of the key mathematics topics for Grade 3:</p>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>1. Multiplication and Division</h2>
        <p>Grade 3 students learn how to understand and apply multiplication and division concepts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Master multiplication tables (up to 10).</li>
            <li>Understand the relationship between multiplication and division.</li>
            <li>Use arrays, repeated addition, and groupings to model multiplication and division.</li>
            <li>Solve simple word problems involving multiplication and division.</li>
            <li>Learn about division with remainders.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>2. Fractions</h2>
        <p>In Grade 3, students learn the basics of fractions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand fractions as part of a whole (e.g., 1/2, 1/3, 1/4).</li>
            <li>Learn to recognize and represent simple fractions using visuals (e.g., pie charts, number lines).</li>
            <li>Understand the concept of equivalent fractions (e.g., 1/2 is the same as 2/4).</li>
            <li>Compare fractions and determine which is larger or smaller using number lines.</li>
            <li>Learn to add and subtract fractions with like denominators (e.g., 1/4 + 2/4).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>3. Addition and Subtraction</h2>
        <p>Grade 3 students strengthen their addition and subtraction skills:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perform addition and subtraction of numbers up to 1000.</li>
            <li>Understand carrying (for addition) and borrowing (for subtraction).</li>
            <li>Solve word problems that involve multi-step addition and subtraction.</li>
            <li>Apply estimation strategies to check the reasonableness of answers.</li>
            <li>Use mental math strategies to solve addition and subtraction problems.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>4. Measurement</h2>
        <p>Students learn to measure various objects and understand measurement concepts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use standard units of measurement (e.g., inches, feet, centimeters, and meters) to measure length.</li>
            <li>Learn to measure the mass of objects using grams and kilograms.</li>
            <li>Understand and use tools like rulers, scales, and thermometers for measurement.</li>
            <li>Learn to measure time and understand the units of time (e.g., hours, minutes, seconds).</li>
            <li>Understand concepts of perimeter and area for basic shapes.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>5. Geometry</h2>
        <p>Grade 3 students explore different shapes and their properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and classify basic 2D shapes (e.g., squares, rectangles, triangles, circles).</li>
            <li>Learn the properties of 3D shapes (e.g., cubes, spheres, cones, cylinders).</li>
            <li>Understand symmetry and recognize symmetrical shapes.</li>
            <li>Explore the concept of angles and identify right angles in shapes.</li>
            <li>Learn how to partition shapes into equal parts and describe them using fractions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>6. Word Problems and Real-Life Applications</h2>
        <p>Grade 3 students use their math skills to solve real-world problems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Solve simple word problems involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</li>
