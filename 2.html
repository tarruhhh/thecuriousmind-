                <li>Identifying tens and ones in a number (e.g., 37 is 3 tens and 7 ones).</li>
                <li>Reading and writing numbers up to 1,000 in standard, expanded, and word form.</li>
                <li>Comparing numbers using greater than (>), less than (<), and equal to (=) symbols.</li>
                <li>Understanding how numbers are built by combining tens and ones.</li>
                <li>Using place value to round numbers to the nearest ten.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="lesson">
            <h2>3. Measurement</h2>
            <p>In this unit, learners will explore the basics of measurement. Key areas include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Measuring length using standard units like centimeters and inches (with rulers or measuring tapes).</li>
                <li>Understanding and comparing weight and capacity (grams, kilograms, liters, and milliliters) using real-world objects.</li>
                <li>Reading time on an analog clock to the nearest 5 minutes (e.g., 3:05, 3:10, etc.).</li>
                <li>Using everyday items to estimate measurements, like guessing the length of a pencil or the weight of an apple.</li>
                <li>Identifying and comparing units of measurement for temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit). </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="lesson">
            <h2>4. Geometry</h2>
            <p>Grade 2 learners will begin exploring basic geometry concepts, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identifying and classifying 2D shapes such as circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles by their properties (number of sides, angles, etc.).</li>
                <li>Recognizing and naming 3D shapes like cubes, spheres, cones, and cylinders.</li>
                <li>Understanding symmetry and finding lines of symmetry in shapes and objects (e.g., a folded paper in half). </li>
                <li>Exploring basic concepts of perimeter (measuring the distance around a shape) and area (the space inside a shape). </li>
                <li>Understanding terms like sides, corners, and angles in shapes and figures.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="lesson">
            <h2>5. Data and Graphing</h2>
            <p>Students will learn how to organize, display, and interpret data. Topics include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating and interpreting bar graphs and pictographs (e.g., tally marks, simple charts).</li>
                <li>Understanding how to collect and organize data (e.g., favorite colors, number of pets, etc.).</li>
                <li>Comparing data using terms like "more than," "less than," and "equal to." </li>
                <li>Understanding the concept of averages and ranges in very simple terms (e.g., finding the most frequent number in a set of data).</li>
                <li>Solving simple word problems using data (e.g., "How many more people like apples than oranges?").</li>
            </ul>
