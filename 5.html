        <ul>
            <li>Multiply multi-digit numbers (up to 4 digits) by one-digit and two-digit numbers.</li>
            <li>Divide multi-digit numbers by one-digit and two-digit divisors, with and without remainders.</li>
            <li>Learn to estimate products and quotients to check for reasonable answers.</li>
            <li>Solve real-world word problems involving multiplication and division of large numbers.</li>
            <li>Apply the distributive property and long division methods to solve complex problems.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>2. Fractions: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division</h2>
        <p>Grade 5 students deepen their understanding of fractions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators by finding the least common denominator (LCD).</li>
            <li>Multiply fractions by whole numbers and by other fractions (e.g., 1/2 × 2 = 1, 1/2 × 2/3 = 2/6).</li>
            <li>Divide fractions by whole numbers and other fractions (e.g., 2 ÷ 1/3 = 6).</li>
            <li>Convert between mixed numbers and improper fractions (e.g., 2 1/2 = 5/2).</li>
            <li>Solve word problems involving fractions in real-world contexts (e.g., recipes, time).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>3. Decimals: Operations and Place Value</h2>
        <p>Grade 5 students explore decimals and perform operations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the place value of decimals up to the thousandths (e.g., 0.75, 3.426).</li>
            <li>Add and subtract decimals (e.g., 2.35 + 3.2 = 5.55, 5.7 - 2.4 = 3.3).</li>
            <li>Multiply and divide decimals by whole numbers (e.g., 0.25 × 4 = 1, 3.6 ÷ 2 = 1.8).</li>
            <li>Compare and order decimals to the thousandths place.</li>
            <li>Convert between fractions and decimals (e.g., 3/4 = 0.75).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>4. Volume and Measurement</h2>
        <p>Grade 5 students learn about volume and measurement in greater detail:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the concept of volume and calculate the volume of rectangular prisms using the formula: V = length × width × height.</li>
            <li>Convert between different units of volume (e.g., milliliters to liters, cubic inches to cubic centimeters).</li>
            <li>Work with both metric and customary units of measurement for length, weight, and volume.</li>
            <li>Solve real-world problems involving measurement, such as finding the volume of a box or container.</li>
            <li>Learn to measure angles using a protractor and understand angle types (acute, right, obtuse).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>5. Geometry and Coordinate Plane</h2>
        <p>Grade 5 students build their understanding of geometry and the coordinate plane:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Classify and compare polygons based on their properties (e.g., quadrilaterals, triangles, pentagons).</li>
            <li>Learn about the coordinate plane, and plot points using ordered pairs (x, y).</li>
            <li>Identify and measure angles in geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, quadrilaterals).</li>
            <li>Calculate the perimeter and area of irregular polygons and composite shapes.</li>
            <li>Explore 3D shapes and their attributes (e.g., cones, spheres, cubes, pyramids, and prisms).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>6. Data and Statistics</h2>
        <p>Grade 5 students learn to collect, analyze, and interpret data:</p>

            <li>Understand the concepts of probability and use simple probability in data analysis (e.g., predicting outcomes).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
        <h2>7. Word Problems and Real-Life Applications</h2>
